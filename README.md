Project Description:  
- Spotify is a digital audio streaming service that offers songs, podcasts, and playlists for
users to create, discover, and listen to. Spotifyâ€™s search feature allows for easy
exploration of music; however, it has limited options when it comes to searching for the right
songs. Better Spotify Search is an app designed to expand the search functionality within the
Spotify application. A look into the Spotify API, reveals hidden characteristics that are stored for each song.
Spotify tracks information such as danceability, energy, song key, loudness, acoustic value,
valence, tempo, time signature, and more. Every single song on Spotify has this data associated
with it. However, users are unable to search for this information directly. Our project intends to add these 
hidden features as additional options to the Spotify search query. Better Spotify Search
offers advanced features such as, allowing users to manually search for songs based off hidden song information,
and providing similar songs based off an input song.
